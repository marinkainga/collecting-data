Dataset description:
Geodatabase of Historical Evidence on Precipitation in Central Europe AD 1013-1504
This dataset contains historical evidence of climate change by using weather reports that describe precipitation in Central Europe between 1013 AD and 1504 AD. Using historical evidence,

List of variables:
ID = identification of source.__
Year = year of the source.__
GE0 = the regional code, place of occurence.__
  CE	= Central Europe__
  NEF	NE = France__
  NEG	NE = Germany__
  SEG	SE = Germany__
	
p-sce1	positive correlation no. 1:  event and primary source__
p-loc1	location of positive correlation no. 1__
CORR = There is probably a correlation but: the specified season of the weather is not where you'd expect it; or we have only implicit testimony to weather e.g. good wheat harvest, poor wine harvest, etc.__
   y	= certain positive correlation__	
  y?	= probable positive correlation__
  n?	= possible negative correlation__
AMBIG-WITN = Ambiguity of written record.__
  0 =  No ambiguity__
  1 = Some ambiguity__
  2 = Considerable ambiguity__
CORR CODE = Correlation of written record with tree ring data.__
a	= historical record positively correlates to proxy data in or near the region of the trees.__
ab = historical record positively correlates to proxy data in or near the region of the trees in the same year that one or more witnesses in the region negatively correlate to the proxy data.__			
b	= historical record negatively correlates to proxy data in or near the region of the trees.__
DECLONG + DECLAT = VALUE =  The p(ositive) or n(egative) value of a precipitation extreme in April, May, and June deduced from the analysis of a database of tree rings from >7000 trees in central Europe.__
